Data Handling
Earnings Data:
The bot stores earnings data locally in a JSON file (earnings.json), which allows it to keep track of players' earnings between games.
Each player's earnings are associated with their unique Discord ID, so if a player changes their name, their earnings history remains intact.
Additional Information
Earnings Summation:

The !record_result command will automatically sum up the player’s earnings as the bot tracks both wins and losses.
For example, if a player wins 50 one week and loses 25 the next, their total will be adjusted accordingly.


Leaderboard Ranking:
The leaderboard ranks players by their total earnings, with the highest earners listed first.





Future Expansion Ideas



Date Tracking:
In the future, you could enhance the !history command by adding date information for each game.
Game Result Verification:
You could add features that allow other players to confirm game results before updating the earnings.


Troubleshooting
If any commands do not work as expected, ensure:
The bot has the necessary permissions in the Discord server.
The bot is online and running without errors.
You have enabled Message Content Intent in the Discord Developer Portal.
